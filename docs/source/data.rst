.. _data:

You can find the links to all preprocessed data used in our manuscript at `Zenodo <10.5281/zenodo.4587662>`_.
All the raw fast5 and fastq files are also available at `ENA <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB40872>`_ and `SGNEx <https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data>`_. Please refer to our Supplementary Table S7 in our manuscript for full details of data download.


Note that all HEK293T-KO samples can be used as unmodified (m6A) controls for any other data set generated with the same RNA kit (SQK-RNA001).
If the cells are genetically different, we recommend to perform variant calling before finalising the list of differentially modified sites in order to remove false positives.
